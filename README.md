#  Blender model of a menger sponge

Created in blender 2.83.

## Overview

* The menger sponge is created procedurally using nodes in the shader editors.
* The fractal is rendered as the _volume_ of a cube mesh.
* Adapted from [this 2D approach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV38FriNoYc) by cgMatter.

Contents:

* `menger-sponge-volume.blend` is a full sponge cube
* `menger-sponge-volume-cut.blend` is a cross-cut of the cube, showing the six-pointed stars.


(!) The current version is not totally correct, as [remarked by /u/MegavirusOfDoom](https://www.reddit.com/r/fractals/comments/hjufap/crosssection_of_a_menger_sponge/fwon1et/) on reddit. Suggestions on how to fix the problem - or a pull request - are welcome.
